# Assembly Style

The native source uses one deliberately small, mechanically checked ca65 style.
It is designed to keep large rename and annotation diffs reviewable while making
editor behavior predictable across platforms.

## Layout

- Use only printable ASCII characters (`0x20` through `0x7E`) and LF line
  endings. Unicode text, typographic punctuation, and non-breaking spaces are
  not allowed in ASM or INC source files.
- End every file with exactly one final newline.
- Do not use tabs or trailing whitespace.
- Do not begin a file with a blank or whitespace-only line.
- Keep at most one blank line between source lines.
- Put every label at column zero on a line of its own. The colon must be the
  final character: put comments on a preceding line and leave no trailing
  whitespace.
- Indent instructions and data-emitting directives by four spaces.
- Indent the contents of `.if`, `.repeat`, `.macro`, and similar blocks by an
  additional four spaces for each nested block.
- Keep structural directives such as `.include`, `.segment`, and `.org` at the
  current block depth.
- Use exactly one space between an instruction or directive and its operand.

```asm
.if ENABLE_DEMO
handler_demo_entry:
    LDA #$01  ; Select demo mode
    .repeat 2
        NOP
    .endrepeat
.endif
```

## Case and Labels

- Write 6502 mnemonics in uppercase: `LDA`, `JSR`, `RTS`.
- Write ca65 directives in lowercase: `.byte`, `.word`, `.include`, `.segment`.
- Write every colon label with its semantic role prefix in lowercase snake_case;
  see `naming.md` for the accepted prefixes.
- Preserve the declared case of constants and operands.
- Keep every active colon label unique across all ASM and INC modules.
- Keep historical names in `provenance/label_renames.json`, not in repeated
  inline `was:` comments.

## Comments

- Write comments and documentation in English. Non-ASCII writing systems are
  rejected with an explicit request for a manual rewrite; the formatter never
  translates or deletes their text.
- Put exactly one space after `;`.
- Put exactly two spaces before an inline comment. Do not align inline comments
  to a shared column.
- Do not put a period at the end of a comment. The formatter removes terminal
  periods, while periods separating multiple sentences inside one comment are
  preserved.
- Prefer comments that explain intent, constraints, or side effects over comments
  that merely restate the instruction.
- Use concise `Inputs`, `Outputs`, `Side effects`, and `Clobbers` notes where a
  routine contract is useful.

```asm
; Wait for two VBlank intervals before continuing reset
bra_wait_for_first_vblank:
    LDA PPU_STATUS
    BPL bra_wait_for_first_vblank

bra_initialize_after_boot_check:
    JSR sub_initialize_memory  ; Clear memory using the pointer in Y
```

## Tooling

Run the complete style and semantic gate without modifying files:

```bash
make lint
```

Apply deterministic whitespace, label-layout, mnemonic-case, and directive-case
normalization, then run the gate again:

```bash
make format
```

The formatter does not rename labels or translate comments. Semantic naming and
English written entirely with unaccented Latin characters remain review
responsibilities.
